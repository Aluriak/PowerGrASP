%
% Constants:
%       - cc: treated connected component. (cc/1 gives existing cc)
%       -  k: current step of treatment (first step is 1)
%       - lowerbound: the minimal cover to reach.
%       - upperbound: the maximal reachable cover.
%
% Input:
%       - edge(X,Y): there exist an edge linking X and Y in cc. (X<Y)
% Output:
%       - newconcept(1,X): X is the member of the clique cc at step k.
%       - clique: motif is a clique.
